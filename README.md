# Git & GitHub Workflows

Different workflows arranged in categories. The commands to be run are listed in order, sometimes with additional explanation. Any italicized words are variables. For instance <i>my-filename</i> is the filename in your project. 

There's a [GitHub Pages][1] site. The buttons are clickable to show or hide a list. The list items are clickable to keep track of steps taken and commands run. Multiple lists and list items can be reset by clicking the Escape key. 

There are also two HTML & CSS only branches. One is a numbered list of commands. The other has a checklist so a user can keep track of steps they've taken. 

Hope you find it helpful. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸ™‚
